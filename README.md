# Blitz
This is a prototype of the Blitz playbook training tool, created in the spring of 2016 by [Taylor Poulos](//twp.io), [Benjamin Alderoty](//balderoty.com), [Avanti Dabholkar](//www.avantidabholkar.com), [Micah Fenner](//micahfenner.com), [Robyn Lambert](//robynlucile.com).

Blitz is an iPad application that quizzes players on their responsibilities on formations and plays, with the goal of helping players have fewer mental errors on the field. It was developed for the team's HCI Capstone at Carnegie Mellon University.

This prototype was built to help us demo and test the way the app is structured from a player's point of view, and also various questions, some of which require tactile answers (such as drawing or dragging and dropping players) in order to fully understand.

This is not intended to be a fully functional product, nor is it intended to act as the base of one. Our priority was getting things working and iterating quickly, not on creating a maintainable codebase.

The prototype has only been tested on an iPad Air 2 running iOS 9.3, and on Chrome 50.0.2661.94 in iPad emulation mode. On other screen sizes and browsers, elements will be misaligned and the interactive components may be broken.


## Running the Prototype Locally

1. If you haven't already, install Ruby and Jekyll

2. Clone your fork of the repo to your computer

3. Run `$ jekyll serve` in the project's directory

4. Navigate to [http://localhost:4000/blitz/](http://localhost:4000/blitz/) in your web browser, and set your browser to emulate an iPad's screen size.


## Using the Prototype on an iPad

1. Navigate to the hosted version of the prototype in Safari. For the foreseeable future, the current version of the prototype will be hosted at [tpoulos.github.io/blitz](http://tpoulos.github.io/blitz)

2. Save the prototype to the [iPad home screen](http://www.gottabemobile.com/2015/01/29/how-to-save-website-shortcuts-to-your-iphone-home-screen/).
